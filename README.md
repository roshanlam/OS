# OS

Run the Setup.sh file before running the OS.

As of now this is just a simple OS which will become a really awesome OS for developers.

## ToDo 

* Integrate Rim with this OS 
* Have a custom installation process (Web Dev, Software Dev, Mobile Dev, ML etc)
* Integrate BlockChain into the OS
* Create a logo For the OS


## Branches 

* Master - The stable version of the OS
* Dev - The experimental verison of the OS


## Goals 
* Make this OS come to live but with less code as possible 
* Use Design patterns and algorthims that will make the OS run smoothly and fastly and at the same time make it easy for someone else to add more features to the code without having a hard time to find out what the means.
